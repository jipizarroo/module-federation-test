Things to know in the futuro.

The manifest that are published are static files => how do we load html first and then JS? should look into SSR techniques for this
and check if they have a major plus on doing so.

There is a problem with TS, TS does not load when using the MFE on another shell/host, should we make a library or export the types also?
